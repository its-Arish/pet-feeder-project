# Automated Pet Feeder Project

This repository contains the coursework for Assignment 1 of the Introduction to Information Technology (4478/8936) unit at the University of Canberra. The project involves designing the logic for a low-cost, automated pet feeder system intended for a local animal shelter.

The solution is developed using the five-step Integrated Problem-Solving Process.

## Repository Structure

The project is organized into folders, with each folder corresponding to a step in the problem-solving process.

* **Step1_Analysis**: Contains the initial problem definition, functional requirements, system assumptions, and a block diagram of the pet feeder system.
* **Step2_Data**: Includes a detailed data table that describes all the necessary inputs (e.g., sensors, time) and outputs (e.g., motor activation, alerts) for the system.
* **Step3_Flowchart**: Contains the visual representation of the system's logic as a flowchart. Both the viewable `.png` file and the editable `.drawio` source file are included.
* **Step4_Word_Code**: Provides the pseudocode (word code) implementation that translates the flowchart's logic into a sequence of actionable steps and functions.
* **Step5_Testing**: Includes a comprehensive truth table with 16 scenarios to test the system's logic, along with a discussion of potential refinements and improvements to the design.
