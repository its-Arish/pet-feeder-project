## Step 5: Upload Your Testing File
Finally, you'll create the Markdown file for your testing, truth table, and refinements section [cite: 82-99].

1.  Go into the **`Step5_Testing`** folder in your GitHub repository.
2.  Create a new file named **`Testing.md`**.
3.  Copy and paste the code below into the new file.

```markdown
## Testing and Refinements
In this step we will analyze the system with truth table and we will also discuss the further refinements that can be done in the future. Hence, to test this system we will assume that we have 4 inputs, 2 output with 2 states (0,1) , which will give us the combination of of (2^4) = 16 possible outcomes.

The two outputs are determined by these exact formulas:
* **Dispense Food (Y) = A AND (NOT B) AND C** :This logic correctly ensures that food is only dispensed when all three conditions are met: it's feed time (A=1), the bin is NOT empty (B=0), and the bowl IS empty (C=1).
* **Alert (Z) = (A AND B) OR (A AND (NOT B) AND C AND (NOT D))**

### Truth Table

| S.N. | A (Is Feed Time?) | B (Is Hopper Empty?) | C (Is Bowl Empty?) | D (Weight Increased?) | Scenario Description | Dispense Food (Y) | Alert (Z) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | Not feed time. | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | Not feed time. | 0 | 0 |
| 2 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | Not feed time. | 0 | 0 |
| 3 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | Not feed time. | 0 | 0 |
| 4 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | Not feed time. | 0 | 0 |
| 5 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | Not feed time. | 0 | 0 |
| 6 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | Not feed time. | 0 | 0 |
| 7 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | Not feed time. | 0 | 0 |
| 8 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | Feed time, Bowl is Not Empty. | 0 | 0 |
| 9 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | Feed time, bowl is not empty. | 0 | 0 |
| 10 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | Dispense Failure (No weight increase). | 1 | 1 |
| 11 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | Dispense Success. | 1 | 0 |
| 12 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | Feed time, hopper empty. | 0 | 1 |
| 13 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | Feed time, hopper empty. | 0 | 1 |
| 14 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | Feed time, hopper empty. | 0 | 1 |
| 15 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | Feed time, hopper empty. | 0 | 1 |

### Discussion and Refinements
The logic now is primitive but fulfills the main requirements. Nevertheless, it can be enhanced with minor adjustments:
* **Add a “snooze”**: The computer may allow a 3-Snooze or a 30 minute grace period to pass between the time a pet is not eating, and an ultimate alarm goes off.
* **Manual Feed Button** : Introduce a physical release button that staff can push manually to release food when the premises is closed.
