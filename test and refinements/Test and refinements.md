## Testing and Refinements

 In this step, we will analyze the system with a truth table and discuss further refinements that can be made in the future[cite: 83].  To test this system, we will assume we have 4 inputs and 2 outputs, each with 2 states (0,1), which will give us a combination of 16 possible outcomes ($2^4$)
 The two outputs are determined by these exact formulas
*  **Dispense Food (Y) = A AND (NOT B) AND C**: This logic correctly ensures that food is only dispensed when all three conditions are met: it's feed time (A=1), the bin is NOT empty (B=0), and the bowl IS empty (C=1)
*  **Alert (Z) = (A AND B) OR (A AND (NOT B) AND C AND (NOT D))**: This logic correctly ensures that the alert is only active high on 5 conditions

### Truth Table

| S.N. | A (Is Feed Time?) | B (Is Hopper Empty?) | C (Is Bowl Empty?) | D (Weight Increased?) | Scenario Description | Dispense Food (Y) | Alert (Z) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | Not feed time. | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | Not feed time. | 0 | 0 |
| 2 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | Not feed time. | 0 | 0 |
| 3 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | Not feed time. | 0 | 0 |
| 4 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | Not feed time. | 0 | 0 |
| 5 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | Not feed time. | 0 | 0 |
| 6 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | Not feed time. | 0 | 0 |
| 7 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | Not feed time. | 0 | 0 |
| 8 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | Feed time, Bowl is Not Empty. | 0 | 0 |
| 9 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | Feed time, bowl is not empty. | 0 | 0 |
| 10 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | Dispense Failure (No weight increase). | 1 | 1 |
| 11 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | Dispense Success. | 1 | 0 |
| 12 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | Feed time, hopper empty. | 0 | 1 |
| 13 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | Feed time, hopper empty. | 0 | 1 |
| 14 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | Feed time, hopper empty. | 0 | 1 |
| 15 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | Feed time, hopper empty. | 0 | 1 |

### Discussion and Refinements

 The current logic is primitive but fulfills the main requirements. Nevertheless, it can be enhanced with minor adjustments:
*  **Add a “snooze”**: A grace period of 30 minutes could be allowed after a pet does not eat before the final alarm goes off.  This would reduce false alarms if a pet is just momentarily distracted.
*  **Manual Feed Button**: A physical button could be introduced to allow staff to dispense food manually.
*  **Distinctive Alerts**: Different alerts could be used for different problems (e.g., a solid red light for an empty hopper, a flashing red light for uneaten food) to make staff immediately aware of the specific issue.
